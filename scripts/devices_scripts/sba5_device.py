# To initiate a command, the USB port or RS232 port sends an ASCII character or string.
# A single character command is acted on immediately when the character is received.
# A string command is acted on after the command string terminator <CR> is received.
# The command can be sent with or without a checksum. If a checksum is sent, a “C” follows
# the checksum value.
# For example,
# Device sends command without checksum: S,11,1<CR>
# Device sends command with checksum: S,11,1,043C<CR>
# On successfully receiving a command string, the SBA5+ sends an acknowledgement by
# echoing back to all the ports the Command String and “OK”, each terminated with a <CR>

# Measurement Command Response
# Measurement format: M aaaaa bbbbb ccc.ccc dd.d ee.eeee ff.ffff gggg hh.h ii.i j
# aaaaa Zero A/D [counts], from last autozero sequence
# bbbbb Current A/D [counts]
# ccc.cc Measured CO2 [ppm],
# dd.d Average IRGA temperature [°C],
# ee.e Humidity [mbar], if humidity sensor is installed

# gggg Atmospheric pressure in IRGA [mbar],
# hh.h IRGA detector temperature [°C],
# ii.i IRGA source temperature [°C],
# j Status/Error code. Continuously displayed measurements do not display the j but

#
# 0 - No errors
# 1 - aaaaa less than 25000 counts
# 2 - dd.d less than 5 °C from user specified temperature
# 3 - dd.d greater than 5 °C from user specified temperature
# 4 - ccc.ccc less than range from L command
# 5 - ee.eeee greater than 90 mbar
# 6 - Board voltage less than 4V


# Measurement String Format Command:
# Fxxx<CR>
# Enables or disables individual measurement fields in the output measurement
# string. Range: 0-255 (integer). For each field desired in the output string, sum
# values from following list:
# aaaaa and bbbbb enabled with value =128,
# dd.d enabled with value =64,
# ee.eeee and ff.ffff enabled with value=32,
# gggg enabled with value=16,
# hh.h and ii.i enabled with value=08,
# j enabled with bit value=04.
# ccc.ccc is always present in output string.
# For example, when value is 212 (=128+64+16+4) the output string will be “M
# aaaaa bbbbb ccc.ccc dd.d gggg j”


# Zero Valve Related Commands
# Z Perform a zero operation.
# Dxxx<CR> Determines whether a zero operation is performed on completion of initial
# warmup or not. If not, then CO2 readings are computed with a previously
# stored zero reading that may produce inaccurate results. Recommended
# practice (and the default) is to perform a zero on power-up.
# Sending “D1” enables the power-up zero, and the string “Zpup=1” is shown in
# the configuration status (in response to a ? command). Sending “D0” disables
# the power-up zero, and the string “Zpup=0” is shown.
# E<char>CR
# Zero operation duration. char: “S” = 21 second,
# “M” = 40 seconds,
# “L” = 90 seconds.
# Default is Short in which the autozero sequence is approximately 20 sec long.
# Longer duration zero cycles can be useful if the flow rate through the SBA-5 is
# lower than 100 ml/min or the measured gas concentration is above 10,000
# ppm to insure fully purging measurement gas from the cell prior to recording a
# zero reading.
# Axxx<CR>
# Time [minutes] between zero operations. range: 0-10000 (integer, but can be
# negative). Recommended maximum setting is 20 minutes. Longer time
# between zero cycles can reduce instrument accuracy.
# Sending the A command with any non-zero value will cause an immediate zero
# operation, followed by subsequent zero operations every value minutes.
# Normally, the SBA-5 performs a series of zero operations at power-up while
# the temperature is stabilizing. The time between these initial zero operations
# is a geometric progression starting at 2 minutes, then 4 minutes, then 8
# minutes, etc. up to the maximum time between zeros as specified in the A
# command.
# It is possible, but not recommended, to disable these progressive zero
# operations during startup by setting the value in the A command to a negative
# number. For example, “A-10” will disable the progressive zeros if the
# configuration is saved with the X command, so that on the next power-up, the
# first timed zero occurs after 10 minutes (there still can be a power-up zero
# immediately after warm-up is complete, depending on the setting of the D
# command and Zpup).
# A0 disables all timed zeros and all progressive zeros. See D command to also
# disable the power-up zero. This is not a recommended setting.
# Wxxx<CR>
# Defines which port of the zero valve has the zero CO2 gas, and which has the
# sample gas to be measured. W0 (Zdir=0) is default and means the zero gas is
# plumbed to the white plastic port on the zero solenoid valve, and the
# measurement port is the metal port. W1 (Zdir=1) means the zero gas is
# plumbed to the metal port, and the measurement gas is the plastic port. Valve
# definitions change immediately upon sending the command.
# Note: In firmware V2.03 and earlier, the “W” command was a single character
# toggle-type command that changed the port state depending on what the
# current state was. In V2.04, it was changed to require a single argument 0 or
# 1


# CO2 Related Commands
# Cxxx<CR> Number of digits to the right of the decimal point for ccc.cc. range: 0-2
# (integer).
# Uxxx<CR> User Scale Factor. range: 0.1-10.0 (floating point). Default is 1.000. Scale
# factor applied to all reported CO2 values to allow user calibrations. There is
# no calibration ‘routine’, The user must calculate their desired scale factor from
# measurements and compute the USF = desired CO 2 ppm / reported CO 2 ppm.
# For example, if the SBA-5 reported 1995 ppm, when calibration gas of known
# 2000 ppm was sampled, then USF = 2000/1995 = 1.0025, and the command
# “U1.0025” would make the SBA-5 read 2000 ppm. User should set USF to
# 1.00 prior to performing recalibration measurements.
#
# Lxxx<CR> Low CO 2 In [ppm] alarm. range: 0-100000 (floating point). In typical
# environmental applications, a CO 2 reading in measurement mode of less than
# 350 ppm indicates a problem with the autozero operation, such as the zero
# gas is not connected, the CO 2 absorber is exhausted, or the zero valve is not
# operating. The Low CO 2 Error helps identify those common problems before
# the abnormal readings can affect subsequent data. This value can be
# adjusted to suit a particular operating environment or can be eliminated
# completely by setting the value to 0.
# Bxxx<CR> Averaging limit for CO2 running average. 0 – no averaging.
# Normally, an exponential running average algorithm is implemented with a
# time response to a step change of 3.5 seconds to 66% of final value and 16.4
# seconds to 99% of final value. If a new instrument reading differs from the
# current running average by more than the Averaging Limit xxx, a new running
# average is begun. Thus when the CO 2 concentration is changing rapidly, the
# averaging is eliminated and the instrument can track changes at the basic
# instrument data rate of 1.0 seconds. When the Averaging Limit value is set to
# 0, no running average is performed. The default Averaging Limit value is 6
# ppm. The running averaging is applied to displayed data and analog output
# signals.
# O<min>,<max>CR
# Analog output CO2VOUT hardware scaling
# min is CO 2 ppm represented by 0 volts, range: 0-100000 (integer),
# max is CO 2 ppm represented by 5 volts, range: 0-100000 (integer).
# H<min>,<max>CR
# Analog output H2OVOUT hardware scaling
# min is H 2 O mbar represented by 0 volts, range: 0-40 (integer),
# max is H 2 O mbar represented by 5 volts, range: 0-40 (integer).
# Other Commands
# Jxxx<CR>
# “J0” sets the spare I/O to digital output representing data valid (default).
# “J1” sets the spare I/O to be a 0-1.2V analog input. In this mode the output of
# the “M” line is modified to include the analog input voltage in millivolts with no
# decimal digits just before the error status field.
# In firmware V2.02 and earlier, there was no J command, and spare I/O was
# used only for a data valid indication.
# Kxxx<CR>
# Turns source lamp on(1) or off(0). This is useful if the SBA-5 is kept powered
# 24/7, but the CO 2 is only read occasionally (i.e. once per hour). By turning the
# lamp off when not in use, the life of the source lamp is extended.
# N Returns two voltage measurements, external board voltage and Spare I/O
# voltage
# Pxxx<CR> Turns the onboard pump from on or off, if one is installed.
# Sending “P0” turns pump off. Sending “P1” turns pump on.
# S,9,xxx<CR> Set the pump power 0-100% when the optional on-board is installed. Default
# 50%.
# Txxx<CR> Sets the control temperature of the IRGA thermostats in degrees C. Range is
# 27 to 60. Default is 55. This is useful for operation in low ambient temperature
# environments to save power. However, CO 2 accuracy will be affected if the
# control temperature is changed from the factory setting.
# V Returns the SBA-5 serial numbers and firmware version numbers
# ? Display the SBA-5 configuration currently in use (the volatile memory working
# area).
# ] Restore the factory default configuration and calibration to the volatile memory
# working area.
